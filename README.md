# calculator

utterly cool and advanced calculator _(not!!)_

### coding stack:
- `JavaScript`
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

### requirements:
- the calculator must be usable on mobile screens
- calculations should be done on the fly, meaning every time you enter operation, previous numbers are automatically processed (so `1+1+` should transform into `2+`)
- backspace button removes one digit if the focus is on numbers (user still adds numbers and operations), or whole number if the focus is on the sum (user hit the `=` button)
- block dividing by zero
- take care of large inputs
- use `input` fields for calculator display

this is a **lvl 2** project, the **deadline is 2 weeks**

###### gl, hf and happy coding! :tada:

#### a picture is worth a thousand words

you pick a project and work on it as you normally would. when you're done, you make a PR and we'll examine your code and give you a review. **we'll review your project 3 times**, so make sure those PRs count. after that, you can (and should) still work on your project and improve it, after all this is your CV :grinning:

after every PR you get a certain score _(you can check those in our app)_ and you go on our ranking list. companies lurk among this list and look for promising developers to hire, make sure you impress them!
