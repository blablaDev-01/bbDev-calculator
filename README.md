# bbDev-calculator

utterly cool and advanced calculator, built solely using `JS`.

with traditional look and modern functions it's gonna be a joy to use it.
your job is to build a web calculator with standard functions.

###requirements:
- calculations should be done on the fly, meaning every time you enter operation, previous numbers are automatically processed (so '1+1+' should transform into '2+')
- backspace button should remove one digit if the focus is on numbers (user is still adding numbers and operations), or whole number if the focus on the sum (user hit the "=" button).
- block dividing by zero
- take care of large inputs
- use `input` fields for display
- if you're feeling brave, make it accessible offline [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/ "google, we know")
